# can be invoked with an activation key or with rhsm_username and rhsm_password
# The intent is as follows:
#   - most systems are subscribed against satellite
#   - only satellite itself needs to register agianst RHN to initiate the process
#   - once satellite is brought up, it unsubscribes from RHN and subscribes against itself
#   - subscriptions are not removed and recreated in the life cylce of a VM,
#     rather they are subscribed at the beginning of their life cycle and
#     unsubscribed at the end of it (i.e. unsubscribe might be messy and leave the system in an inconsistent state)
